After the topic selection comes a search strategy to gather all background information. We need to have a search strategy to organize our ideas, using specific keywords and Boolean operators. This helps with refining it further into a more focused knowledge pool. Evaluation of sources and referencing are also covered. Peer-reviewed and up-to-date sources are essential. Where to search is equally important. Search for academic journals through the library, Google Scholar, arXiv etc. Once I started to develop the research question, I was overwhelmed with all the literature available on my intended topic. Some were related to entirely different disciplines and expertise. However, as I kept at it, keeping this workshop in mind along with the question development workshop, it helped not only to focus my research area but also to organize my research articles to a much more manageable number. A main paper can become the base of the entire topic and using the cited references within that article we can get much more thorough picture. This was obvious, but I still need to work more on it. It has certainly thrown new light on my understanding of some topics. It also helps to get a feeling for either knowledge gaps or consensus on some things. In the past, I have always concluded that maybe this was all but moving forward I will keep this in mind.</p> <p>Once we have the necessary articles, we need a reference manager to manage and cite them in the required format. EndNote provided by the USQ can help with that. We learned how to use EndNote. I have used Mendeley Reference Manager in the past, so in some ways it was similar, though I had to always turn normal Harvard style into Harvard AGPS6 manually with that. EndNote with the Harvard AGPS6 plugin, that happens automatically, making the process less tedious and more streamlined. However, I still need to get more familiar with it because it lacks many functions and requires much more troubleshooting compared to Mendeley. For the moment, I am going to keep a similar library in Mendeley as well till I can fully get rid of further issues. If I had to start again, this searching strategy will help things move much more actively.</p> </body></html>
