Electricity is one of three components of total energy production, alongside transport and heating (Ritchie and Rosado, 2020).There are various methods of electricity production, such as using fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear energy.

We will take a look at Australia and the 27 EU countries to see if there are any differences in the mix of electricity sources. This analysis focuses on the breakdown of these sources and how Australia contrasts with the EU in energy production. And where are we headed? Data was downloaded from Ritchie et al.(2023).

As we can see -
- Low carbon sources in the EU are mainly hydropower and nuclear; Australia does not have nuclear power.

- Wind and solar are rapidly growing in both regions.

- Dramatic changes in the electricity mix are evident over time. Both regions show a steady decline in coal's role in electricity production.

- Population growth has led to increased electricity demand and hence more production in both regions.But Australia still remains more dependent on coal compared to the EU.

#### By 1990

- Most of Electrcity genrated was from fossils fuels

- 90% of Australia's electricity was generated from fossil fuels.

#### By 2022

There is clearly a shift towards more renewables sources of energy.

- Clearly great strides in renewables to generate electricity.

- EU nearly has even split between fossils and renewables.

- Australia has increased its renewable elctricity production 3 times.

- In EU, low carbon  generation of electricty is increasing steadily while fossils use is declining

- In Australia there is a more dramatic uptick of low carbons and a downturn for fossils use in electricty production.

- Solar and wind are the drivers of this growth.
 
- We can clearly see this accelerates two times- first one around 2008 and the second one around 2016

- This timing match the Kyoto protocol (ATS, 2008)  and the Paris agreement (ATS, 2016).

### SUMMARY

The main question we are trying to address is: How does the electricity mix Of Australia compare to the EU, and in future which source of electricity should we invest more in?

- We found that  the current dominant sources of electricity in Australia and the EU are coal and gas.

- Australia remains heavily dependent on coal compared to the EU.

- There is a continued decline in coal use and growth in wind and solar in both regions. 

We suggest that Australia should further diversify its energy mix by accelerating the transition to low-carbon sources, following the approach of European Union and as a participator in international climage negotiations (Loynes KL,2017).
