Electricity is one of three components of total energy production, alongside transport and heating (Ritchie and Rosado, 2020). There are various methods of electricity production, such as using fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear energy.

We will look at Australia and the 27 EU countries to see if there are any differences in the mix of electricity sources. This analysis focuses on the breakdown of these sources and how Australia contrasts with the EU in energy production. And where are we headed? Data was downloaded from Ritchie et al.(2023).

    </div>
</div>

As we can see -
- Low carbon sources in the EU are mainly hydropower and nuclear; Australia does not have nuclear power.

- Wind and solar are rapidly growing in both regions.

- Dramatic changes in the electricity mix are evident over time. Both regions show a steady decline in coal's role in electricity production.

- Population growth has led to increased electricity demand and hence more production in both regions. However, Australia remains more dependent on coal.

#### By 1990s

- Most of the Electricity generated was from fossil fuels.

- 90% of Australia's electricity was generated from fossil fuels.

#### By 2022

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/proj/p1/3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- There is a shift towards more renewable sources of energy.

- EU has nearly even split between fossils and renewables.

- Australia has increased its renewable electricity production 3 times.

#### Low Carbons(Nuclear and Renewables) Vs Fossils

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/proj/p1/4.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- Generally, low-carbons use is increasing in the generation of electricity while fossil use is declining.

- We can see this accelerates two times- the first one around 2008 and the second one around 2016
These timings align with the Kyoto Protocol (ATS, 2008) and the Paris Agreement (ATS, 2016).

#### Australian Future

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/proj/p1/5.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

- In Australia, there is a more dramatic uptick in low-carbons and a downturn in fossil use in electricity production.

- Solar and wind are the main drivers of this growth.

#### SUMMARY

The main question we are trying to address is: How does the electricity mix Of Australia compare to the EU, and in future which source of electricity should we invest more in?

- We found that the current dominant sources of electricity in Australia and the EU are coal and gas.

- Australia remains heavily dependent on coal compared to the EU.

- There is a continued decline in coal use and growth in wind and solar in both regions.

We suggest that Australia should further diversify its energy mix by accelerating the transition to low-carbon sources, following the approach of the European Union and as a participator in international climate negotiations (Loynes KL,2017).
