Reading the instructions and watching the related workshop gave me a general idea of how and where to start. When I did my undergraduate degree, it was highly focused on habitability. And Europa, Callisto, and Titan have always fascinated me with their potential for life. So, I started there, with Europa as my preference. While going through the forum posts, I found that another student had posted almost the same question that I was trying to form. Then I started looking at other questions, what else have I learned through all that literature? Titan came to the forefront with nitrogen as a main constituent of its atmosphere, its methane cycle and its subsurface ocean. Some of the things I found were way out of my comprehension, so I looked through the material, trying to focus on the side things I could continue to explore. Nitrogen on Titan looked promising, and I collected a lot of journals pertaining to the subject in a reference manager to go through all that more thoroughly. When I posted my research question and started peer reviews of fellow studentsâ€™ questions, I found I could give them more focused answers than to myself. I have always had problems with writing, getting lost in the vastness of the topic and ending up doing nothing. But I was able to tell others exactly the way they should go about it. This experience, along with the helpful feedback from my peers, gave me enough insight into what to focus on and how broad the subject should be in the given timeframe. This helped me to get more specific with my question. This will surely make me well-prepared to tackle the literature review.
