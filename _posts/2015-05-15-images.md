EH Lib is an intrinsically variable pulsating star. V-band images of the EH Lib star were provided to me for a report when I was doing module ‘Observational Astronomy PHY 8001’ at USQ in early 2023. This excerpt is taken from that assignment. Using the astronomical image processor [AstroImageJ](https://www.astro.louisville.edu./software/astroimagej/index.html)differential aperture photometry was performed on this data to produce the light curve for the EH Lib, revealing a clear variation in magnitude (flux change of 0.5 in V-band) as seen in the figure below. The star’s period, P, was determined to be ~ 0.09 days. We can see the light curve below exhibits an asymmetric shape. It indicates a rapid increase in flux followed by a slower decrease in brightness.
