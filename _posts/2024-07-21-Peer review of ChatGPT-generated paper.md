ChatGPT has come a long way in a short amount of time. But can it produce a review paper that meets publication standards? Previously, I posted a literature review addressing the question: “What is the source of nitrogen on Titan?” I then asked ChatGPT to generate a similar review on the topic: “What is the source of nitrogen on Triton?” Here is the ChatGPT-generated paper and my peer review of it -

My Question- What is the source of nitrogen in Titan's atmosphere?

Revised Question- What is the source of nitrogen in Triton's atmosphere?

ChatGPT Question- Can you create a 2000 word literature review, using the research ques>on “What
is the source of nitrogen in Triton's atmosphere?” with citatons?
