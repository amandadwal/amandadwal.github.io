I noticed while critiquing the AI-generated review that compressing such a broad topic into a short format can often lead to missing some details. For example, how various processes on Titan fit into the wider context of planetary science or habitability. The importance of Titan’s comparisons with Earth can also be confusing for those not well-versed in the subject. Previously, I have struggled to find the right balance between being too detailed and overly brief. Transitions from one line of thought to another have been challenging, making it difficult to guide the flow of thought. After completing the first draft, I noticed the same issue: the flow was lacking. In response, I opted to cut out entire sections that dealt with complex chemical processes and physical mechanisms, choosing instead to focus more on Titan’s significance in the context of planetary exploration and habitability.</p> <p>This change felt abrupt and required significant reworking and many revisions to improve clarity and flow. It seemed to enhance the flow, but it also felt lacking in details. Details that I had spent countless hours working on. Instead, it felt very generic. However, after reviewing my presentation, I recognise that this restructuring has improved the overall quality. The changes make the narrative more coherent and accessible to a broader audience. This experience underscored the importance of keeping the intended audience in mind. Moving forward, academically and in other areas of my life, I will try this approach. It will improve the clarity and impact of my communications.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="astronomy"/><category term="SCI6103"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The literature review I did early on was detail-heavy on the formation and evolution of Titan.

After the topic selection comes a search strategy to gather all background information. We need to have a search strategy to organize our ideas, using specific keywords and Boolean operators. This helps with refining it further into a more focused knowledge pool. Evaluation of sources and referencing are also covered. Peer-reviewed and up-to-date sources are essential. Where to search is equally important. Search for academic journals through the library, Google Scholar, arXiv etc. Once I started to develop the research question, I was overwhelmed with all the literature available on my intended topic. Some were related to entirely different disciplines and expertise. However, as I kept at it, keeping this workshop in mind along with the question development workshop, it helped not only to focus my research area but also to organize my research articles to a much more manageable number. A main paper can become the base of the entire topic and using the cited references within that article we can get much more thorough picture. This was obvious, but I still need to work more on it. It has certainly thrown new light on my understanding of some topics. It also helps to get a feeling for either knowledge gaps or consensus on some things. In the past, I have always concluded that maybe this was all but moving forward I will keep this in mind.</p> <p>Once we have the necessary articles, we need a reference manager to manage and cite them in the required format. EndNote provided by the USQ can help with that. We learned how to use EndNote. I have used Mendeley Reference Manager in the past, so in some ways it was similar, though I had to always turn normal Harvard style into Harvard AGPS6 manually with that. EndNote with the Harvard AGPS6 plugin, that happens automatically, making the process less tedious and more streamlined. However, I still need to get more familiar with it because it lacks many functions and requires much more troubleshooting compared to Mendeley. For the moment, I am going to keep a similar library in Mendeley as well till I can fully get rid of further issues. If I had to start again, this searching strategy will help things move much more actively.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="SCI6103"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This workshop teaches the fundamentals of research skills- mainly searching, organizing, and referencing.

However, it is not currently an issue in astrophysics, though with space exploration it might become relevant in the future. Whether that will involve people on board or considerations regarding animals, contamination or disease transfer to different planetary ecosystems.</p> <p>For now, as per Dr. Holt’s instructions, I am going to reflect upon a specific area of my field. Research ethics can equally be applied to academic integrity. It could involve blatant plagiarism or having some good practices that make academic and scientific research communications more robust. Academic integrity It leads to more honesty, fairness, and openness and eliminates falsification and deception. We can fall short of academic standards sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Each item whether that is an image, dataset, table or figure – everything needs to be properly cited. Having a good reference manager, such as the Mendeley reference generator or Endnote can help us with that. Keeping a record of every idea we come across that we may want to use – jotting that down somewhere is essential. This is not only for future reference but also if you need to prove how you came up with that idea or conclusion. Good academic practises will lead to creativity, application, and development while preventing misuse and deception. Principles such as honesty, trust, fairness, and respect are essential in research. Avoiding cheating and collusion is crucial. Do not present ideas as your own without proper citations. Use proper sources, respected journals, and peer-reviewed articles. Avoid dodgy websites like Wikipedia. I have struggled in the past to formulate my own words. Sometimes, no matter what I write, it seems like I am just quoting. Learning to rephrase is an important skill, and I still sometimes struggle with it. Sometimes giving it a bit of time can help form a more coherent narrative in your mind. And stepping away from it all for some time can be beneficial.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="SCI6103"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This workshop focused mainly on animal and human ethics, which is very important.

I have always run out of time, squeezing tasks in here and there, and missing out on vital milestones. I find the Gantt chart approach very interesting for visualizing tasks and planning. Even in this course, I came to the planning part much later. I did some preliminary planning, but it wasn’t very thorough, and I still need to keep at it and adjust it to my preference and schedule. I can see where I have made certain mistakes. I tend to get bogged down doing some tasks and completely run out of time for others. Now, I have broken the project into more manageable chunks according to my current understanding of the course and my pace. However, I am still running a week late, so I will allocate more time to some tasks and try to come up to date soon. I need to work more on planning. Moving forward, I’ll try to incorporate more of this into my upcoming courses, as well as my personal and professional life.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="SCI6103"/><category term="astronomy"/><category term="workshop"/><category term="reflections"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This workshop made me realise how unconventional and unorganized I am at certain things.
