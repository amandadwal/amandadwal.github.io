## Applications/tools that I love to use and support-

Most of these are free, for some there is a paid pro version but there is no need to use that for most of us.

- [AstroImageJ](https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/): AstroImageJ is an open-source software designed for the analysis and visualization of astronomical images, providing tools for tasks such as photometry, astrometry, and image processing.

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): is a good place to start for a scientific Python environment. It comes with a navigator app for easy access to the most used tools, such as Spyder IDE and Jupyter Labs notebooks.

- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/): A reference manager which is easy to use and integrate with MS Word and plently of plugin available for formatting.

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): An Online LaTeX Editor

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a lightweight, open-source code editor featuring support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and a vast ecosystem of extensions.

- [Github](https://github.com/): A platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to host, manage, and share their code repositories.

## Getting started- reading list -

Most of these should be freely accessible from the library. If not, there are always video tutorials on Youtube etc., that we can use to learn most of this - these days.

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) by R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani. This book has two versions- with applications in either Python or R. Both versions are free to download.

- [A Beginner's Guide to Working with Astronomical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13189) by
Markus Pössel 

- [Essential Python for the Physicist](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-45027-4) by Giovanni Moruzzi
