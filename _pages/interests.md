### Astronomy

I’m fascinated by all aspects of astronomy, especially those related to habitability. The origin of life is a significant unknown, and our future as humans is deeply connected to our understanding of other planetary bodies.

#### Stellar Evolution
I am curious about the life cycles of stars and the processes that create the elements essential for life. I want to understand the mechanisms of stellar birth, evolution, and death.

#### Extreme Environmental Astrophysics
I am drawn to the study of extreme conditions in the universe and the associated high-energy phenomena, such as various accretion disc outbursts.

####  Exoplanets
I am interested in the methods used to find exoplanets, determining their various properties, and characterizing these distant worlds to understand their atmospheres and potential for habitability.

####  Astrobiology
Everything comes down to this—I am intrigued by the search for life beyond Earth. Exploring the origins of life, what are the necessary conditions that make a world habitable? And is there potential for the existence of extraterrestrial organisms or intelligence?

### Data visualisation and modelling

Alongside astronomy, data analysis with Python, as well as data visualisation and modelling, are major interests that drive me. The ability to leverage data to uncover insights, especially within large, complex datasets, is powerful and fascinating. Using Python for data manipulation, combined with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful visual representations. Data modelling further fuels my curiosity as it enables simulations and predictions that can bring theoretical concepts to life.

### Literature

Beyond the sciences, I have a deep interest in literature from the Victorian period, with its intricate depictions of society and human character, and 19th-century Russian literature, known for its philosophical depth and existential themes. These works explore the human experience and continue to resonate with the timeless challenges and questions we all face.

### Cinema and Music

I am also passionate about Asian cinema, which offers a rich variety of storytelling techniques, unique visual styles, and cultural perspectives. Films from directors in South Korea, Iran, and India especially capture my interest for their ability to delve deeply into the human psyche, social dynamics, and historical contexts. Additionally, listening to Hindi music, with its diversity ranging from classical to contemporary genres, is a cherished passion of mine.
