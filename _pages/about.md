Hello, I’m Aman Kumar! My journey into data and astrophysics has been anything but traditional. It has combined experiences from hospitality, analytics, and a lifelong fascination with the stars.

I started in the hospitality industry in a remote part of Perth. With limited entertainment, I unexpectedly found myself diving into online courses through the Open University, UK. One broad science course was all it took to awaken a dormant curiosity about the universe. This initial spark led me down a new path: pursuing a part-time honours degree in Astronomy and Planetary Science. What began as a passion project gradually transformed into something more profound, and in the wake of COVID-19, I enrolled in a Master’s program in Astrophysics at the University of Southern Queensland.

In parallel, I’ve been sharpening my analytical skills, bridging the gap between my curious mind and a desire to make sense of vast datasets—whether astronomical or business-related. Armed with tools like Excel, MySQL, SPSS, Python, and Tableau, I’ve built a strong foundation in statistics, visualization, and data analysis. I’ve realised how much I enjoy working with data, using it to tell compelling stories and drive informed decisions.

Now, I hope this portfolio reflects my journey and skills, highlighting my dual passion for data analytics and the wonders of the cosmos. I am particularly interested in data visualizations that bring insights to life—whether analysing customer patterns or uncovering trends among the stars.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope my story resonates with you.
